# TaskFlow

**TaskFlow** is a powerful automation platform designed to help users streamline their workflows. It allows users to create custom workflows that respond to specific triggers, making it easier to automate repetitive tasks and save time. 

## Features

- **Webhook Trigger**: Users can create workflows that are triggered by webhooks. This allows external services or applications to initiate workflows within TaskFlow when certain events occur.
  
- **Email Action**: Once triggered, TaskFlow can perform a variety of actions, including sending automated emails. This is useful for sending notifications, confirmations, or any kind of automated response.
  
- **Redis Stream for Sequential Execution**: TaskFlow ensures that actions within a workflow are executed in the correct sequence by leveraging Redis Streams. This guarantees that each action is performed one after the other, maintaining the integrity of the workflow.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Workflow**: Users can define workflows that consist of a webhook trigger and one or more actions, such as sending an email.
  
2. **Webhook Trigger Activation**: When the webhook is called, TaskFlow captures the event and begins executing the associated actions.

3. **Sequential Execution**: Each action is processed sequentially through Redis Streams, ensuring that actions are completed in the intended order.

## Use Cases

- Automate email notifications based on webhook events.
- Build workflows that respond to real-time data from external services.
- Ensure tasks are executed in the correct order, such as approval flows or multi-step processes.

TaskFlow simplifies complex workflows, making automation accessible to everyone, while ensuring reliable and orderly execution of each task.
